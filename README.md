# KARD. v0.1
## Create your own portfolio site in minutes

## Start
Install all the node modules with `npm i` and run a webpack build with `npm run build`
Running `npm run start:dev:seed` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)

## Setting up profile

To utilize all the functionality, I would these sites to create a high-quality headshot url

### Create a PNG, removes background (free)
https://www.remove.bg/upload

### Free image hosting site (Be sure to get the full url which has .png at the end)
https://imgbb.com/
